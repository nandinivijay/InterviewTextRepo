This is a keyword used in feature file.Background keyword is used to write the steps which are common for every scenario.
So, it will run before every scenario.For Example, if we have two scenarios like one is adding to cart and another is checkout,
for both the scenarios we have to login which is common.So, we write login scenario with the help of background keyword it will first login to our account
and search an item then for second scenario also it will first run the background keyword then it will run checkout scenario.
